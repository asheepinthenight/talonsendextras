## Known Issues
- Display scaling above 100% sometimes causes text to be hidden under the top and bottom menu bars
  - This has been mostly resolved, but if you have this issue, please report it along with your browser and screen resolution.
- Icons are invisible when playing offline
  - This is a side effect of using Font Awesome icons. I have plans to replace them with unicode or another offline-friendly alternative in the future.
- Not tested with assistive software
  - I do not have access to assistive software and have not been able to test this UI with it. If you use assistive software and have trouble playing, please let me know.
